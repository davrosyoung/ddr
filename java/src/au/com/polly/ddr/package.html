    <title>DDR - Dave's Data Reduction</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Reduces the number of lines of data required to represent the flow rate data from a gas/oil well's production data.
Key classes are;
    <ul>
    <li><b>{@link ExcelDataConverter}</b> - hides the messiness involved in working with dates stored in Microsoft Excel.</li>
    <li><b>{@link ExcelStandardizedGasWellDataExtractor}</b> - extracts data sets from an excel spreadsheet in a standarized format.</li>
    <li><b>{@link ExcellCellLocation}</b> - enables us to navigate around an excel worksheet.</li>
    <li><b>{@link GasWellDataLocator}</b> - Whereabouts within a source of data that the data for a specific gas well may be located.</li>
    <li><b>{@link GasWellDataEntry}</b> - flow rates for a single time period for a specific gas well.</li>
    <li><b>{@link GasWellDataSet}</b> - the collection of gas well data entries for a continuous period of time for a specific gas well.</li>
    <li><b>{@link SimpleDiscontinuityDataRateReducer}</b> - calculates a reduced set of time intervals to represent a set of gas well data entries. Especially designed to pick up gas well transitioning from production to maintenance.</li></lib>
    <li><b>{@link SimpleOverlayPlotGrapher}</b> - plots both original data set and reduced data set upon same graph.</li></lib>
    </ul>
